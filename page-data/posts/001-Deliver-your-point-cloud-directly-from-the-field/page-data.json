I got it in a comfy backpack which helps a lot to carry the entire set. X7’s body has a big handle which helps to place it on the tripod.

Tablet is very robust, waterproof with IP-65, and heavy-duty but also quite heavy. On the one hand, robustness like this is desired when you work in difficult conditions like the construction site or factory. On the other hand, it is uncomfortable to use in long term. Even with the arm-stripes, the user feels the weight on the arms and back very quickly. I had the only over-arm type of stripe, so perhaps some harness-type stripes could be much nicer to use with the tablet.</p><p>First things first. I divide this review into two parts: fieldwork and processing of the data.</p><h4>Fieldwork</h4><p>The user doesn’t need any long introduction training to begin work with the X7. Do not understand it, my dear reader, that is simple equipment which can be used by anyone. It is a powerful scanner with many advanced features but at the same time quite easy to use for less advanced operators. Most of the features and options are intuitive. I lost myself in the very beginning but I believe it is because I am not used to so many options.</p><p>The scanner connects with the tablet via WiFi and there is no trouble pairing them. The user can start scanning in a few moments. When the Trimble Perspective is up and running and X7 mounted on the tripod, you have to choose the resolution of the scan from four available options: 2, 4, 7, and 15 minutes, sensitivity, either take a pano-images or not with or without HDR, and white balance preset. During the entire scanning process, you are informed by notifications about happened actions like scan is over or created connection between scan stations. This is a really useful feature and helps to not get confused among software’s options.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PB0xkamgr4Q3KmJbHErreg.png\" /><figcaption>Tab. scanning parameters — trimble.com</figcaption></figure><p>Since the user hit button — Start Scan — the scanner begins some “dancing” which is the calibration and auto-leveling process. The first dance is always the longest and is shorten in the next scan stations. Trimble X7 has implemented one more cool feature! The build-in compensator indicates by 3 LEDs respectively to each leg of a tripod, when the scanner is out of auto-level’s range. It is easy then to quickly change the position or the height of this particular leg which of course has to be done before starting scanning. When it is calibrated and leveled, the magic begins.</p><p>I was very surprised when the acquisition began because it was silent! Wow! My experience with other brands is different. Every scanner I used until I tried X7 was loud or very loud like RTC360. That is a pleasant feeling when the equipment you daily work with is silent and does not bother people in the nearest zone. I see it is very useful in projects where you have to scan offices during working hours and you don’t bother people around you.</p><p>Trimble X7 is fast but not as fast as I expected and as Trimble claims. I found out that a single scan station in medium resolution and standard scan mode takes mostly about 4min 52sec. It includes auto-calibration, self-leveling, scanning, and taking pictures. Datasheet informs about 3:30 of scanning time and taking pictures for mentioned settings which is almost 1min and 20sec shorter. Reality is different! You perhaps wonder about weather conditions and scanned environment. I believe that a picture was taken that day present it the best. There are no reasons why the scanning time is longer than the estimated shown on the tablet’s screen.</p><p>The self-leveling feature works great.

In the case of a project with over 150 scans and the necessity of an extra scan for each 10th scanner position, the project’s price will increase by about 1,5 hours.</p><h4>Battery</h4><p>A quick summary about batteries. They contain led indicators of capacity level which helps to recognize the proper time for charging. Acquisitions were done in very good weather conditions. It was a sunny day with approx. 17 C deg.
