In this example, I had also trouble combining data. I occur that between scans on opposite sides of the two-line street where distance was approx. 22m, scans couldn’t be connected by the auto-alignment feature. I had to connect them manually but the result was not impressive. An extra scan would be a solution to fix it and give more overlap among scans but then I would have to do it in the middle of the cross-road.
