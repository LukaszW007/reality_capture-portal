It happens before a landsurveyor would come to measure pipes or even without calling a landsurveyor. Why does it happen? It is because very often the excavation is relatively small, which doesn’t give a big income for X, but the waiting time for a landsurveyor generates a loss. The excavator is not used then and does not earn money for company X. Then X sends the data to the ladnsurveyor and expects to extract all of the information from the point cloud. Unfortunately, our landsurveyor doesn’t know are the data correct, what is the accuracy of GNSS position, and the measurement itself. X claims that they did their job and even delivered measurements. X’s employee does not know what is multipathing, which side of the sky should be open to getting better GNSS measurement’s precision and the pictures cannot be blurry. The landsurveyor has to take responsibility for the mapped information — position in XYZ of the pipes and all of the related elements and the height of the surrounded ground. In this scenario, he has two options, either accept the X’s measurement and hope that the quality is good enough, or discuss with company X, listens to its complaints, and do his job properly. My quite long experience as a landsurveyor on construction sites suggests me this scenario would happen too often.</p><p><strong>Scenario 2.</strong><br>An employee from company X, who does the scanning, does not understand the difference between coordinate systems so scans in any coordinate system or in the last used coordinate system. What if the current project has a requirement to maintain it in a different coordinate system? The landsurveyor has to transform the data to the correct coordinate system which in case of long excavation and different cartographic projections in those coordinate systems would create extra inaccuracy in the data.</p><p>Those are only two scenarios that popped up in my head but I believe could be found more. I believe the app with RTK antenna for iPhone/iPad is really great solution as supplementation of landsurveyors/geomatics daily work or at least good trained employee of a company from other industry than the surveying. I understand that producers of surveying equipment or software want to sell their products as much as possible even though it would be done for inappropriate people, but it can make more mischief than good.
