First impressions? WOW! Size, weight, short initialization time and generally speaking mobility! My first thought was — perfect for any projects where I have to travel by plane. Easy to pack to your hand luggage and no extra cost in a project. You get the device, a total of 3 batteries which last for approx. an hour of continuous scanning, charger, USB cable, stand (which is useful during initialization of the device) and a plastic case for the scanner, and 2 batteries. As far as I remember you have to pay about 500$ for a soft bag to carry the entire set.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fi9eypJx4EhV5hhz0PL4Tw.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Fot. The front of BLK2GO</figcaption></figure><p>When I took it into my hands then I realized that the bottom part where are mounted cameras and handle is made of solid and pleasant in touch metal — anodized aluminum. Unfortunately, the top part which covers two LiDAR heads is made of plastic which I believe is the only way to have a semi-transparent coverage of the laser heads but gives a feeling of cheapness. It also worried me how robust is it and how any scratches would affect the quality of the data — especially possible when you would use it in industrial projects.</p><h3>Let’s scan!</h3><p>Leica seller gave me a really short introduction to the workflow and usage of the app. This time the BLK2GO live app was available only on the iOS platform and compatible with iPhones not iPads. Luckily it is available on iPads and Android devices as well! When the app was installed and ready to use, the first time popped up an error about connectivity with the scanner. Reset of the app and the device solved the problem. App connected correctly to BLK2GO and notified me about readiness by using colors yellow/green. I clicked the button on the scanner’s housing and the app informed me what to do next. I had to hold the device stable for a few seconds to initialize it and begin the acquisition process. I used the dedicated plate which has a small bolt that helps to place the scanner correctly on the plate and prevent unwanted moves. On the app appeared first collected points which meant I could walk and scan.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/360/1*vooGmOSE9sqKVXhS1YdPjg.gif\" /><figcaption>Fot. Connection with the BLK2GO</figcaption></figure><p>I tried to walk quite stable and with constant velocity. I was instructed to hold the scanner, not in front of me but a bit to the site so I would be out of range panorama cameras. During the acquisition, I could see the progress of the scanning in 2D which was helpful to recognize in the space what was covered and where I should walk to collect more data.</p><h3>The APP</h3><p>Let’s talk about the app. It is very simple and doesn’t give you an overwhelming impression. You can either scan or browse projects saved on the device. The scanning section lets the user observe the progress of the acquisition, jump between 2D and 3D view, and change the elevation of data presented currently on the screen. Unfortunately, when the user begins to manipulate the 3D view, the app loses the scanner’s position in point cloud space. It means that the view doesn’t recenter to the current BLK2GO position in 3D. The user has no possibility to recenter it as well. The view has to be switched to 2D and back to 3D to recenter and follow the trajectory. Another issue I observed happens when you scan more than one floor in a single project. The 2D view is not following the trajectory in Z-axis so when you let’s say go upstairs, the trajectory and the dot (indicating spatial scanner’s position) disappear. The view in the app still shows you the data from the floor below and not your current position. You have to change the view elevation manually by using a slider. During the scanning, you are also able to create geotags with a picture and some description which is useful in cases you know what you should focus on. The project created from your last walk gets the default name which you can rename later on.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/360/1*FVQ-JT5KVejaNICaGBxCQg.gif\" /><figcaption>Fot.

As I mentioned, here you can rename particular projects, change the thumbnail, and add a description. It is possible to check the data in 2D and 3D. Unfortunately, a 3D overview of the data is not really a 3D view. It is the kind of recording of the trajectory without the possibility to see entire data at once. It is perfectly shown in the video below.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FPG4B-dirv3M&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DPG4B-dirv3M&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FPG4B-dirv3M%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/bf767936beb98459b2495b2020d31679/href\">https://medium.com/media/bf767936beb98459b2495b2020d31679/href</a></iframe><h3>Data acquisition</h3><p>In 2020 I have done 10 walks/running with the BLK2GO in different environments: an office with glass walls and huge windows, a parking lot, an outdoor scanning in an urban environment, and a busy street.
