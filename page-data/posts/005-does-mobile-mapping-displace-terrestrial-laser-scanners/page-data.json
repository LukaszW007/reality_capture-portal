It is a lightweight, portable, and wireless handheld scanner for mobile mapping. It was announced in 2019 and released in 2020. It also won the Best of Innovation award at CES2020.</p><p>Is it as good as it is described in brochures? What about data quality? Can you use it for the purpose described in this article’s introduction? Let’s take a look deeper into this device and the possibilities it brings.</p><br /><br /><h3><strong>BLK2GO in 2020 - first look, first impression</strong></h3><br /><p>In April 2020 was my first encounter with this device. First impressions? WOW! Size, weight, short initialization time and generally speaking mobility! My first thought was - perfect for any projects where I have to travel by plane. Easy to pack to your hand luggage and no extra cost in a project. You get the device, a total of 3 batteries which last for approx. an hour of continuous scanning, charger, USB cable, stand (which is useful during initialization of the device) and a plastic case for the scanner, and 2 batteries. As far as I remember you have to pay about 500$ for a soft bag to carry the entire set.</p><br />","type":"paragraph"}],"link_to_iframe":null,"list_of_articles":null,"image_banner":null},"items":[{"articles_to_link":null}]},{"slice_type":"banner_with_caption","primary":{"rich_text_in_post":null,"link_to_iframe":null,"list_of_articles":null,"image_banner":{"alt":"The front of BLK2GO","url":"https://images.prismic.io/3d-points/dac95dfa-d9c3-4969-9979-5817b699c043_IMG_20210308_065954.jpg?auto=compress,format&rect=0,8,1642,2172&w=650&h=860","copyright":"The front of BLK2GO"}},"items":[{"articles_to_link":null}]},{"slice_type":"text","primary":{"rich_text_in_post":[{"text":"<p>When I took it into my hands then I realized that the bottom part where are mounted cameras and handle is made of solid and pleasant in touch metal - anodized aluminum. Unfortunately, the top part which covers two LiDAR heads is made of plastic which I believe is the only way to have a semi-transparent coverage of the laser heads but gives a feeling of cheapness. It also worried me how robust is it and how any scratches would affect the quality of the data - especially possible when you would use it in industrial projects.</p><br /><br /><h3><strong>Let’s scan!</strong></h3><br /><p>Leica seller gave me a really short introduction to the workflow and usage of the app. This time the BLK2GO live app was available only on the iOS platform and compatible with iPhones not iPads. Luckily it is available on iPads and Android devices as well! When the app was installed and ready to use, the first time popped up an error about connectivity with the scanner. Reset of the app and the device solved the problem. App connected correctly to BLK2GO and notified me about readiness by using colors yellow/green. I clicked the button on the scanner’s housing and the app informed me what to do next. I had to hold the device stable for a few seconds to initialize it and begin the acquisition process. I used the dedicated plate which has a small bolt that helps to place the scanner correctly on the plate and prevent unwanted moves. On the app appeared first collected points which meant I could walk and scan.</p><br />","type":"paragraph"}],"link_to_iframe":null,"list_of_articles":null,"image_banner":null},"items":[{"articles_to_link":null}]},{"slice_type":"embed","primary":{"rich_text_in_post":null,"link_to_iframe":[{"text":"<iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/gr2BgxmCYapchTzCaa\" width=\"270\" height=\"480\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/gr2BgxmCYapchTzCaa\">via GIPHY</a></p>"}],"list_of_articles":null,"image_banner":null},"items":[{"articles_to_link":null}]},{"slice_type":"text","primary":{"rich_text_in_post":[{"text":"<p>I tried to walk quite stable and with constant velocity. I was instructed to hold the scanner, not in front of me but a bit to the site so I would be out of range panorama cameras. During the acquisition, I could see the progress of the scanning in 2D which was helpful to recognize in the space what was covered and where I should walk to collect more data.</p> <br /><br /><h3><strong>The APP</strong></h3><br /><p>Let’s talk about the app. It is very simple and doesn’t give you an overwhelming impression. You can either scan or browse projects saved on the device. The scanning section lets the user observe the progress of the acquisition, jump between 2D and 3D view, and change the elevation of data presented currently on the screen. Unfortunately, when the user begins to manipulate the 3D view, the app loses the scanner’s position in point cloud space. It means that the view doesn’t recenter to the current BLK2GO position in 3D. The user has no possibility to recenter it as well. The view has to be switched to 2D and back to 3D to recenter and follow the trajectory. Another issue I observed happens when you scan more than one floor in a single project. The 2D view is not following the trajectory in Z-axis so when you let’s say go upstairs, the trajectory and the dot (indicating spatial scanner’s position) disappear. The view in the app still shows you the data from the floor below and not your current position. You have to change the view elevation manually by using a slider. During the scanning, you are also able to create geotags with a picture and some description which is useful in cases you know what you should focus on. The project created from your last walk gets the default name which you can rename later on.</p><br />","type":"paragraph"}],"link_to_iframe":null,"list_of_articles":null,"image_banner":null},"items":[{"articles_to_link":null}]},{"slice_type":"banner_with_caption","primary":{"rich_text_in_post":null,"link_to_iframe":null,"list_of_articles":null,"image_banner":{"alt":"Screencapture of the app during geo-tagging","url":"https://images.prismic.io/3d-points/e5e7f403-c73e-461e-ba60-eea97a62fe1e_capture+geotag+optimized.gif?auto=compress,format","copyright":"Screencapture of the app during geo-tagging"}},"items":[{"articles_to_link":null}]},{"slice_type":"embed","primary":{"rich_text_in_post":null,"link_to_iframe":[{"text":"<iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/FMlQ8qIdNF0Rbzxp2E\" width=\"270\" height=\"480\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/FMlQ8qIdNF0Rbzxp2E\">via GIPHY</a></p>"}],"list_of_articles":null,"image_banner":null},"items":[{"articles_to_link":null}]},{"slice_type":"text","primary":{"rich_text_in_post":[{"text":"<br /><p>The second portion of the BLK2GO Live App is browsing the stored projects and collected data.

Stay tuned!</p> <br /><p>Generally speaking, the BLK2GO is a handy, robust, and simple-to-use device. Since 2020, Leica improved the firmware and the software which makes it more stable and pleasant to use. It still has some issues with odd and unexpected errors. The app needs some minor fixes and adjustments like recentering and 3D overview. The device itself is not so comfortable to use as backpacks solutions. Even though it is lightweight after a few walks you are going to feel your arm and your back. I am a rather trained person but I could feel my muscles the day after.
