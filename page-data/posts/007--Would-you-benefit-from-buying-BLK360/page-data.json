In my case, where I mostly work with RTC360 last few months, I noticed Blk360 is much slower. The acquisition part is kind of annoying because of the relatively long time of waiting for the data to download from the scanner to the tablet. Yes, Blk360 does not store data in any internal memory. All of the scans (point clouds and images) are downloaded to the device which runs the Leica Field360. So the waiting time can be so long in high scanning resolutions that I don’t see any point to use it. I am going to present this situation in numbers:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/956/1*WzNs7VZjWJd8baWc2LSyRw.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Tab.

It has a single button that is not just to power on/off but also to scan. This feature is called Push Button Operation and lets to scan up to 100 medium resolution scans - I never checked this capacity out.

Point clouds</h3><p>Like any other TLS, Blk360 collects point clouds and HDR pictures but also takes thermal pictures.</p><p>Let&#39;s start with the main reason why people invest in laser scanners - a point cloud. Blk360 has a rather weaker laser comparing to its bigger siblings like RTC360 or C and P series. That’s why the point cloud is neither as dense as previously mentioned nor has as long-range as them. This means a need for more scans in the same scanning area comparing to competitors and therefore more time spent in the field. It also means some troubles from time to time to combine single scan stations with high accuracy.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qXMRoPAaQHgG3EnNPFo3hg.png\" /><figcaption>Pict.

Scanning in low temperatures.</figcaption></figure><p>One of the projects I have worked on was done to check the verticality of an old chimney and test out the usability of TLS in such cases. Most of the scan stations could be placed close to the scanned object. Unfortunately, to cover with point cloud the entire construction, I had to have a minimum of one scan station on the other side of the river - up to 20m wide. I worried about the distance approx. 25 meters between outdoor scans can be too long. Processing the data confirmed my fears. Only one of four connections (the shortest one) Leica Cyclone Register 360 connected with an error lower than 15mm. The rest of them had errors over 35mm. In the case of precision measurements, Blk360 is not a good choice at all, and I could experience that.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*q6-gy86GHCMBCTbm1VUhZA.png\" /><figcaption>Pict.

All of the red connections were over 25 meters in between the scan stations.</figcaption></figure><p>Point clouds generated by Blk360 miss most of the points representing black and very dark brown elements of scanned space. It looks similar to the BLK2GO’s problem with scanning very dark surfaces. I talked to other users of Blk360 and they confirmed having the same issue so it’s not the problem of my unit.</p><p>Anyway, short-range point clouds look very good and for sure can be used for visualizations, BIM, or CAD modeling. In my opinion, it is the perfect device to scan inside small size buildings or be a perfect extension of the Matterport device.</p><h3>Camera and taken pictures</h3><p>Blk360 produces panoramic pictures by sticking pictures taken by 3 built-in 15Mpx cameras. The entire panorama has 150Mpx and can be taken in HDR (High Dynamic Range). This means that a user gets quite good quality pictures which can be good documentation of the project’s space. In halfway of zooming pano, the quality drops which makes trouble to read labels or see details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*M2x3EzKtIgdTiLnHPx7k4A.png\" /><figcaption>Pict.

HDR is not automatically applied to a pano picture but the user can switch to HDR mode and use a slider to adjust the brightness to their own preferences or needs. Leica Truview Local users have to rely on images adjusted during the post-processing. Truview Local does not give a chance to have an HDR slider.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Rd4NnAOYV9TAqdTbGkyUcQ.png\" /><figcaption>Pict.

Zoomed in the pano-picture.</figcaption></figure><p>As mentioned previously, Blk360 has an unusual feature which is thermal pictures. What does it mean and how does it work exactly? During taking pictures, the device captures thermal panoramic image 360°x70°. It uses a FLIR system created by Teledyne. the thermal picture is not a full-dome picture like RGB panorama which covers 360°x300°.</p><p><strong>The thermal pictures</strong> can be useful in the case of e.g. auditing apartments or entire houses for the determination of the building’s thermal class. I believe that professionals, who work with thermal checks every day, know more robust and professional equipment to use. Anyway, Blk360 has this feature and some of the users probably would benefit from it. I see a quite good use case in the situation of scanning a technical room with many pipes. The thermal images can be additional information for MEP professionals to recognize failure in the piping installation.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9i5P2-rEtyZoStRKYHpzDQ.png\" /><figcaption>Pict.
